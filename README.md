Detection of Phishing Attack Using Machine Learning Models

Phishing is a treacherous attempt to embezzle personal information such as bank account
details, credit card information, social security number, employment details, and online
shopping account passwords and so on from internet users. Phishing, or stealing of sensitive
information on the web, has dealt a major blow to Internet security in recent times. These
attacks use spurious emails or websites designed to fool users into divulging personal financial
data by emulating the trusted brands of well-known banks, e-commerce and credit card
companies.

Here, I have proposed a method for Phishing Attack Detection using Decision Tree Classifier model. The Model Training, Testing dataset is Colleted from UCI REPOSITORY.
Model 1 is build using all the existing feature and tried to achive maximum Accuracy with reduced feature. Features selected based using Chi square test, Mutal information method and two different models are build.
These Models works effectively with limited number of features set without reduction in Accuracy compared with Model1.
